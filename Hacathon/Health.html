        <h2> Ramadan and your health </h2>
        <p>​Ramadan is special time for reflection, self-improvement, kindness and spirituality - and fasting is one of the key pillars of the Holy Month, with those observing Ramadan fasting from dawn to dusk.

            Here are some of the positive impacts fasting can have on your health and well-being:
            
            Regulates ‘bad’ cholesterol
            Many people aim to lose some weight by fasting. However, a recent study found that fasting also affects the lipid profile. This results in reduced blood cholesterol, which can keep heart attacks, strokes and other diseases at bay.
            Curbed appetite
            Observing Ramadan and fasting gives your lifestyle and digestive system a positive U-turn. As your body gets used to eating less, your digestive system gets a chance to rest and your stomach gradually shrinks in size. This reduces your appetite, and the results can last longer than many trend diets.
            A month-long detox
            Fasting not only uses your fat reserves, but also cleanses your body of harmful toxins that might be present in fat deposits. With the digestive system on a month-long overhaul, your body naturally detoxifies, giving you the opportunity to continue a healthier lifestyle beyond Ramadan.
            Boosted mood and mental clarity
            Fasting can be a method of ‘supercharging’ the brain, increasing growth and development of new brain cells, in turn sharpening responses to information in the world around us. Studies also show that fasting can also make the brain more resilient to stress, more adaptable to change, and can improve mood, memory and even learning capacity.</p>
